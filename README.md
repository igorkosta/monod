# monod [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/monod.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/monod)
# Why
If you use a `monorepo` to manage your lambda functions and every lambda
function has its own folder - you can use `monod` to deploy them.

# TODOs
- [] Ignore `__tests__`, `node_modules`
- [] Use .monodignore to ignore folders being deployed
