# monod [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/monod.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/monod)
# Why
If you use a `monorepo` to manage your lambda functions and every lambda
function has its own folder - you can use `monod` to deploy them.

# TODOs
- [ ] Check if any of the available lambdas has been chosen (don't allow empty choice)
- [ ] Get the list of aws-regions
